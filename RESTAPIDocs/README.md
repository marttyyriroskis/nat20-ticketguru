# REST API Documentation Templates

## In Markdown

Inspired by [@iros](https://github.com/iros)'s [documentation
gist](https://gist.github.com/iros/3426278).

Focus on using the templating Markdown to create comprehensive, structured and
helpful API documentation. Structure should be regular and repeated across
endpoints and between projects.

## By example

All templates are provided by example:

* [Examples](examples) - For each template, a completed anonymised example.
Where possible this example comes from a real project.

## Free
