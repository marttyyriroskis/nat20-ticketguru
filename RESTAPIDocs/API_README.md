# REST API Documentation Templates

## What's in this documentation

This documentation contains endpoints to which you can make REST API requests. If an endpoint or a request is not specified, it cannot be requested through the API.

Below you can find a table of contents to the REST API request calls. Please note that for some tables/entities, there are two possible GET requests:
1. GET request to get all resources in the table (getAll)
2. GET request to get a specific resource from the table specified by its id (getById)
